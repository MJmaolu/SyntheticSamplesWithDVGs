# SyntheticSamplesWithDVGs
Collection of simulated fastq samples for the evaluation of the program DVGfinder


## Composition files

Each composition file contains the DVG population that conforms the sample. Each one of the DVG are identified by its ID (cID_DI). Also, the Breakpoint (BP), Reinitation site (RI) and sense of the fragments pre and post BP-RI junction are specified. The type of defective is more clearly defined in the 'DVG_type' column and the ratio of the genome in the sample ('proportion') and the total length of the defective ('length_dvg') are also
